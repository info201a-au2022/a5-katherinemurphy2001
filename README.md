# Assignment 5: Climate Change
In this assignment, you'll build an interactive Shiny application exploring CO2 emissions data. You'll need to create all of the necessary files for your work (e.g., `app.R`, `app_ui.R`, `app_server.R`). See Canvas for details.

Once you have completed your work, make sure to host your application on https://www.shinyapps.io/.
